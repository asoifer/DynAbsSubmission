Welcome to DynAbs, the Abstract Dynamic Slicer for C#.

Folders:

** src: DynAbs source code with several unit tests for covering most of the syntax structures and representative cases of C#.

** Olden: it contains the source code for C# and Java (analyzed with Javaslicer)
Also:
-- JavaSlicerRunner.sh --> script with the parameters
-- config: configurations for DynAbs
// we changed the paths for anonymizing the submission, hence, 
// they should be modified for executing again
-- output 
	--> DynAbs compilations + traces (in instrumented folder)
	--> Javaslicer results
	--> DynAbs results

** ROSLYN AND POWERSHELL
The repositories are too heavy for uploading to this server.
For that reason, we anonymized our repositories.
There are 4 repositories:

Powershell - Used version (Non-Instrumented): https://anonymous.4open.science/r/PowerShell-F1F2/README.md
Powershell - Instrumented: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/PowerShell-DB54/README.md

Roslyn - Used version (Non-Instrumented): https://anonymous.4open.science/r/roslyn-51AD/README.md
Roslyn - Instrumented: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/roslyn-660D/README.md

On the other hand...
Powershell traces and results are located in powershell folder.
Roslyn traces (just StatementParsingTest and TypeTests due to their huge size) and results (all of them) are in roslyn folder.

** Example
Finally, there is an (old) available example but representative of our work. 
It can be found on: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/abstract_dynamic_slicer_demo-02AD/README.md

In the future, full source code will be available for the community,

** Note:
For replicate all of the experiments several configuration files are needed.
In the final version of the public repository of DynAbs those configuration files will be available.
